// Tasks/Activities:
/* 
Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
• Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

let firstNum = 15;
let secondNum = 10;
//Task 1
let sum = firstNum + secondNum;
console.log(sum);

//Task 2
difference = firstNum - secondNum;
console.log(difference);

//Task 3
product = firstNum * secondNum;
console.log(product);

// Task 4
divide = firstNum / secondNum;
console.log(divide);

//Task 5
remainder = firstNum % secondNum;
console.log(remainder);

*/

/*
Activity 2: Assignment Operators
• Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
• Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

//Ans
// Task 6
let num = 5;
let increment = (num += 1);
console.log(increment);

// Task 7
let decrement = (num -= 2);
console.log(decrement);
*/

/*
Activity 3: Comparison Operators
• Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
• Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
• Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

// Task 8
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
console.log(a > b);
console.log(b < 30);

// Task 9
let x = 10;
let y = 0;
console.log(x <= 10); //Output: True
console.log(y >= -10); //Output: True

// Task 10
let firstNum = 20;
let secondNum = 20;
let thirdNum = "20";

console.log(firstNum == thirdNum); //Output: True
console.log(firstNum == secondNum); //Output: True
console.log(firstNum === thirdNum); //Output: False

*/

/*
Activity 4: Logical Operators
• Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
• Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
• Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

let firstNum = 15;
let secondNum = 10;
console.log(firstNum > secondNum && firstNum == 15); //True
console.log(firstNum > secondNum && firstNum == 18); //False

console.log(firstNum > secondNum || firstNum == 15); //True
console.log(firstNum > secondNum || firstNum == 18); //True
console.log(firstNum == 1 || secondNum == 2); //False

console.log(firstNum != 0); //True
console.log(secondNum != 10); //False
*/

/*
Activity 5: Ternary Operator
• Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

//Task 14
let number = 69;
number > 0 ? console.log("It is Positive\n") : console.log("It is Negative\n");

*/

/*
Feature Request:
1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
• Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
• Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
• Compare values using comparison operators.
• Combine conditions using logical operators.
• Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
